This activity included the following components from Module 4:

1. **Event-Driven Programming (Signals and Slots)**  
   I connected button clicks (signals) to custom methods (slots) such as `__on_add_contact` and `__on_remove_contact`. This allowed the window to react to user actions.

2. **PySide6 Widgets**  
   I used several PySide6 widgets including `QLineEdit` for input, `QPushButton` for actions, `QTableWidget` for displaying contacts, and `QLabel` for status messages.

3. **Message Boxes and User Interaction**  
   I implemented a `QMessageBox` to confirm deletion of a contact. This added an interactive step for the user before a row is removed from the table.
